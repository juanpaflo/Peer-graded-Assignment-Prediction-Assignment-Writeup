# Peer-graded-Assignment-Prediction-Assignment-Writeup

This is to present the analysis of the data gathered from 6 subjects while performing an excercise (barbell lift) in 5 different ways, the data was obtained using accelorometers placed in different parts of the body. There are two sets of this data, one is the training set and the other one is the test set. The training set is used to build a model to predict the "classe" (how well is the exercise done), this model will be used to predict the classes of 20 test cases.
